// The seat-claim backstop: ready work a seat owns and never picked up.
//
// The three lanes that came before this one each key on something OTHER than
// "what work does this seat own right now". nudgeStalledPoolClaims keys on the
// slot's bound gc.trigger_bead_id; nudgeStalledPoolContinuations keys on the one
// preassigned graph-v2 successor of a step that already completed; and
// nudgeStalledPoolExecution (the execution backstop) starts at the CLAIM and
// only ever looks at in_progress rows. So the state none of them covers is the
// one ga-evxqd reproduced live: a configured named seat, awake and quiet, with
// an OPEN bead routed to its own identity, no assignee, and zero unmet
// dependencies — sitting untouched for three hours until a human assigned it by
// hand and nudged the pane. The trigger-bead keying has the same blind spot for
// pool slots (a slot idle for 22 hours next to its own open assigned bead), and
// this lane closes both, because "the seat's own open work" is an IDENTITY
// question rather than a binding one.
//
// # The escalation is a nudge, and it stays a nudge
//
// The execution backstop ends at a drain, and it has to: the seat there holds an
// in_progress row that nothing else will release, so the stop -> close ->
// dead-assignee reopen chain is the only convergence available. Nothing is
// stranded here. The row is still OPEN, every claim probe in the fleet can still
// see it, and any other seat may take it. Draining a live seat over work it
// merely has not started would destroy a healthy session to fix nothing. So this
// lane re-nudges on the same bounded ladder, reports the first exhausted budget
// as one typed event, and then RE-ARMS instead of latching silent — a one-shot
// latch here would mean a seat that ignores three nudges is never contacted
// again, which is exactly the permanent silence the incident produced.
//
// # Why it cannot double-nudge the lanes it sits beside
//
// Three structural exclusions, all in resolve/snapshot rather than in timing:
//
//   - An in_progress row under any of the seat's identities hands the WHOLE seat
//     to the execution backstop for that tick.
//   - The slot's own bound gc.trigger_bead_id is skipped: nudgeStalledPoolClaims
//     already re-delivers for exactly that bead on exactly this cadence.
//   - A preassigned graph-v2 successor ON A POOL SEAT — an open task, assigned,
//     carrying gc.continuation_group with gc.session_affinity=require, under a
//     seat stamped pool_managed=true — is skipped, because that is
//     nudgeStalledPoolContinuations' candidate shape verbatim
//     (continuationRowCouldBeCandidate) on the only seats it governs. It is also
//     the most common graph-v2 handoff row in the fleet, so admitting it there
//     would put two independent persisted ladders on the same bead every backoff
//     window. Worse, the two lanes disagree on purpose about the cap: that one
//     latches silent at three attempts, this one re-arms forever, so the overlap
//     would not merely double the nudges — it would override the continuation
//     lane's designed stop.
//
// The pool_managed half of that third condition is load-bearing.
// poolContinuationBackstop.governs takes pool slots and nothing else, so the
// identical row on a NAMED seat is not that lane's population at all and
// excluding it here defers to nobody — it leaves the row covered by neither
// lane, permanently silent with a claimable bead in front of it, which is the
// ga-evxqd symptom on the exact population this lane was built for. Nor is that
// shape exotic on a named seat: a shared-context drain stamps the continuation
// pair on every executable item step whatever the step routes to
// (applySharedDrainContext, internal/dispatch/drain.go), graphroute's
// SessionName and DirectSessionID branches assign the step to a concrete session
// while leaving the pair intact (only the pool MetadataOnly branch rewrites it,
// ApplyGraphRouteBinding), and preassignHookContinuationGroup pins a molecule's
// open siblings to whoever claims first on ANY gc hook --claim. So the exclusion
// is scoped to the seats the continuation lane actually serves; on a named seat
// there is no second ladder to collide with and the row is this lane's to nudge.

// the engine offers no later callback to carry the cursor. Durability is not
// optional either — a cursor that reset on every controller restart would walk
// the same prefix forever on a city that restarts more often than it rotates.
//
// Being on the hold path is also why it has to be PACED. Every other write in
// this lane is spent by an event — a new row observed, an attempt delivered, a
// clear proved — so a quiet fleet writes nothing. This one is spent by a
// condition that persists: a seat whose blocked queue outruns the probe budget
// has a reason to rotate on every patrol tick, forever, for as long as the queue
// stays long. Unpaced that is a steady-state session-bead write per seat per
// tick, which is the write class that produced the cache-reconcile flood. So
// rotation rides the same backoff clock the ladder does, with the last rotation
// stamped beside the cursor. Coverage is unaffected: the windows still tile the
// whole ring, one window per backoff period instead of one per tick, and the
// ladder they feed runs on that period anyway.
//
// The line is the signal the original lane lacked — before it, a seat whose
// queue outran the probe budget was indistinguishable on stdout from a seat with
// nothing ready, and one of those was the incident. It is printed only when the
// cursor actually moves, so the paced ticks stay as silent as they are free.
