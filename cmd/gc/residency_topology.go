// The cmd/gc topology constructors: opened routes as data.
//
// storeref's residency resolver is pure — it plans over a Topology and opens
// nothing. This file builds that Topology for the two cmd/gc planes: the
// one-shot CLI (which resolves its own storage funnel) and the controller
// (which opened its binding at boot).
//
// # From OPENED ROUTES, never from config
//
// This is the cityQueryTopology lesson, and it is why neither constructor reads
// [storage]. storageSplitShapeOf reads the section alone and answers "no split"
// for a city whose section was DELETED after it had already served one. That
// city's infrastructure beads are in a binding, its boot refuses, and its
// routes serve every infrastructure class from refusedClassStore. Asking config
// would build it a work-only topology whose plans read the work ledger and
// report "no work" forever; asking the ROUTES gets the refusal, which fails
// loud with the sentence that names the remedy.
//
// # Told, not deciding
//
// A constructor takes the opened work and rig stores it is handed and the
// routes this process already resolved. It does not decide which rigs are
// serving — a suspended rig is simply absent from the map it is given — and it
// does not decide whether a binding mints truthfully: nothing in this build
// verifies a binding's mint prefix, so MintsReserved stays false everywhere
// here and the residence probe stays in every plan. The corpus already carries
// the retired row, so the day verification ships this is a bit, not a redesign.
