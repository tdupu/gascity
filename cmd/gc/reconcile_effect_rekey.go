// The rekey effect (CONTRACT v5 S4; owner ruling 3): arm A3's intent to
// align a row's instance_token with the runtime of the same row that carries
// an older token, so that runtime reads Current and its stop's L2 passes.
// Under the runtime name lock (lockRuntimeName), and then the row's session
// mutation lock held through the CAS (rereadAndWrite), it re-reads the
// runtime fresh: presence, then identity (readRuntimeIdentity), then
// presence again on the same session object. It proceeds only while the runtime is still StaleSelf to the
// pass's row under S4's guards, with the token the pass saw
// (rekeyStillHolds). Then it is the row-write effect: one CAS of
// instance_token that re-decides on the fresh row, so the row is still open,
// at the generation and token the pass saw (the basis), and still holds no
// pending_create_claim (rekeyable). It never writes generation. A probing
// effect (60s); not boot-gated, and it costs no token.

// causeIdentityChanged refuses a rekey whose fresh read no longer finds the
// runtime the pass saw. A refusal backs the row off (P4).
