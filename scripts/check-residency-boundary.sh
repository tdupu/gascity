#
# The eleventh blind reader must be unwritable.
#
# The typed-store split shipped a PLACEMENT contract (one authoritative accessor
# per class for "which store OWNS creates of class C"). It never shipped a
# LOOKUP contract, and "which stores answer this question, in what order, with
# what failure semantics" was hand-rolled at ~90 call sites built from two
# binding-blind base enumerators. internal/storeref's residency resolver is now
# that contract; this guard is what stops a ninety-first site from being
# written.
#
# WHAT IT SCANS: non-test .go under cmd/gc, internal/api, internal/sling and
# internal/dispatch, for the store-enumeration vocabulary declared in
# scripts/residency-boundary-patterns.txt — four families:
#
#   (a) base-enumerator consumption — BeadStores(), rigBeadStores(),
#       coordClassStoreCandidates(, workAssignmentStores(,
#       openAllConvoyStoresAt(, openConvoyStores(, openSourceWorkflowStores(,
#       convoyStoreCandidates(. None of these ever contains a class binding, so
#       every list built from one is binding-blind by construction.
#   (b) direct binding-gate re-derivation — graphClassBinding(,
#       routes.storeFor(, storeref.ClassCandidates(. Asking "is this class
#       relocated" a second time is how the split-store bug class reproduces
#       (#5125, #5127).
#   (c) hand-rolled probe lists and plan disassembly — a []beads.Store{ literal,
#       and reaching a PlanLeg's .Leg.Store directly. The executor
#       (ResolveOwner/Union) is the only place leg order and per-leg error policy
#       are applied; a literal list skips both, and so does a consumer that runs
#       a plan's legs itself. Zero hits today, so the first one is a violation.
#   (d) bespoke residence probes — IDInNamespace(, bdIDIsClassReserved(,
#       ReservedClassPrefix(. The namespace gate is the resolver's, and a site
#       that re-derives it is one `gc storage migrate` away from ga-axin6.
#
# THE RATCHET: scripts/residency-boundary-baseline.txt pins today's census as
# `path <TAB> enclosing function <TAB> pattern <TAB> count`. The check fails on any hit ABOVE the pinned
# count (a new blind reader, unwritable from day one) and on any pinned count
# the tree no longer reaches (the baseline must SHRINK in the same commit that
# retires a site). Shrink-only, like the resource-census ratchet.
#
# WHY COUNTS-PER-FUNCTION AND NOT LINE NUMBERS: a file:line baseline fails on
# every edit ABOVE a pinned line, which turns the guard into a false-positive
# generator for unrelated work and trains reviewers to rubber-stamp the marker.
# Counts are immune to line drift and still forbid growth. Keyed by file ALONE
# they were also maskable — a new site paired with a removal in the same file
# kept the count level, and since family (a) is consumption-shaped the
# signature-level AST half could not see it either. The enclosing function is
# therefore part of the key.
#
# THE HONEST RESIDUAL: a swap WITHIN one function of one pattern — deleting one
# `BeadStores()` call and adding another in the same function — still keeps the
# count level. That is a much smaller hole than the file-level one, it is
# visible in the diff of a single function, and the AST half additionally
# catches any new store-list SIGNATURE, which is the shape a genuinely new
# resolver-bypassing helper takes.
#
# SELF-TEST: `--self-test` proves the guard's own bite on real temp trees (new
# site fails, marker suppresses, stale baseline fails, fail-closed cases fail).
# `make check-residency-boundary` runs it before the real check.
#
# ESCAPE HATCH: a trailing `// residency:allow <reason>` on the line, same
# discipline as `// boundary:allow`. Regenerating the baseline to absorb a new
# hit defeats the ratchet: the diff is the review.
#
# FAILS CLOSED: a missing scan directory, an unreadable baseline, or a census
# that finds nothing at all is a violation, not a pass. A guard that silently
# passes when it cannot evaluate manufactures false confidence.

set -uo pipefail # intentionally NOT -e: run every check and aggregate.

# census prints `path <TAB> function <TAB> pattern <TAB> count`, sorted.
#
# WHY THE FUNCTION IS PART OF THE KEY: a count keyed by file alone masks a
# consumption site that is PAIRED with a removal — delete one rigBeadStores()
# call in city_runtime.go, add a different one in another function of the same
# file, and the count is level. Family (a) is the bulk of this baseline and is
# consumption-shaped, so the signature-level AST half cannot see that swap
# either. Keying by enclosing function shrinks the hole to a swap WITHIN one
# function, which is the honest residual and is small enough that the diff shows
# it.
#
# ENCLOSING FUNCTION is read the way gofmt guarantees it can be: a top-level
# declaration starts at column 0, and only a top-level body closes with a `}` at
# column 0, so a state machine over those two lines attributes every line to its
# top-level function (a closure's hits belong to the function containing it) or
# to (file-scope). `make fmt-check` is what keeps that guarantee true. The Go
# half runs the identical rule, so the two halves key the same way by
# construction.
#
# A comment line, and a line bearing the `// residency:allow` marker, is not a
# site. One awk pass over every scanned file rather than one grep per (file,
# pattern): the guard runs on every commit, and a quadratic scan is a guard
# people disable.
