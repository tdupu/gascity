// CloseAll's PER-BEAD route, which is what a backing with no batch applier
// takes. The route CloseAll takes when one is available is one request per
// chunk and is pinned next door, in native_dolt_store_batch_close_test.go;
// closeChainStorage below refuses the applier so this file keeps measuring the
// loop rather than silently becoming a second test of the batch.
//
// The metadata-then-close pair is gc's one write chain that needs a value an
// earlier write in the same chain produced: gc stamps close_reason into the
// metadata, and the close carries that reason.
//
// It used to recover the reason with a follow-up read — Close's own GetIssue,
// dialed on top of the status read the loop already makes. The lifecycle role
// answers every write with its post-state snapshot (issueops.UpdateResult.Issue,
// the member that also carries the post-write RowVersion a guarded chain
// composes its next ExpectedVersion from), so the reason comes off the result.
//
// A backend that violates that contract (answers Update with no post-state
// Issue) still needs a reason from somewhere, and the fallback for it re-reads
// through the Reader role — the same door the loop's own status read already
// takes — rather than a raw GetIssue. There is no raw door left in this chain
// at all.
//
// The doubles below make both halves observable: rawReads counts any RAW
// GetIssue the chain dials (none, on the current route) and roleReads counts
// every Reader.Get. A re-introduced raw follow-up shows up as a nonzero
// rawReads; a reason taken from the pre-write row shows up as the stale value.

// IssueLifecycle() accessor, so a SECOND resolution of THAT accessor is the
// re-entry, deterministically and with no timing. Resolving IssueReader() for
// the fallback read is not a second lifecycle resolution and is not the
// hazard this guards against — it is the same category of call as the
