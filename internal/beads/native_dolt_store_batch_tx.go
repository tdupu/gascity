// The fallback Store.Tx route for a backing store that has no transaction.
//
// Store.Tx's contract is "every write in this callback lands together", and the
// native route delivers it with one Dolt transaction. A store reached over the
// v0 wire has none to open: RunInTransaction is off the served surface and
// refuses with a typed *beadslib.ErrUnsupported before the callback is ever
// invoked. Without a second route every reconciler close site — the
// metadata-then-close pair that stamps a session's terminal state and then
// retires it — would fail outright on a served city.
//
// This stays the FALLBACK, tried only after RunInTransaction refuses as
// unsupported, on purpose: issueops.UpdateItem validates every metadata key
// the role's way, where the native map-based tx.UpdateIssue does not
// (TestNativeDoltStoreMetadataKeyRuleSplitsByRoute pins this as a deliberate
// asymmetry). Trying this route first on a LOCAL backend that has a working
// transaction would silently tighten that contract for every Store.Tx caller,
// not just the served backend that actually needs it.
//
// The second route is issueops.BatchApplier: ONE request whose items are
// applied inside one transaction the SERVER opens, all or nothing. So the
// callback is not executed against a live transaction at all; it is RECORDED
// into items, and the recording is dialed once when the callback returns
// cleanly. That inversion is what buys three properties the native route does
// not have on this backend:
//
//   - atomic, because the server's transaction spans the whole item list;
//   - reason-preserving, because a close item CARRIES its reason, where the
//     native tx.CloseIssue had to read it back out of the row;
//   - nothing-on-failure, because a callback that errors has dialed no request.
//
// WHAT IT CANNOT RECORD, it refuses by name rather than approximating:
//
//   - CREATE. A create inside the callback must hand back a minted id
//     immediately — extmsg's bind reads it to key the transcript membership it
//     creates in the same callback — and an undialed batch has no id to give.
//     The id arrives in ApplyBatchResult.Keys, which is a caller-shaped answer,
//     so the sites that create inside a Tx are the ones that have to be
//     rewritten against BatchApplier directly. (ga-8tiw9)
//   - REPARENT. issueops.UpdateItem carries Patch.ParentID and the in-process
//     appliers honor it, but the http client's apply encoder refuses that
//     member (W-ApplyPatch.ParentID): apply publishes no parent_id even though
//     updateIssue does. Refusing here names the member; letting it through
//     would surface the encoder's refusal as an opaque transport error at the
//     one call site — an Update carrying ParentID — that can explain it.
//   - OVER CAP. A callback recording more than issueops.MaxApplyBatchItems
//     items cannot dial as one request either; refusing by name here is more
//     actionable than letting the server reject an oversized wire request.
//
// READS ARE NOT IN THE TRANSACTION, and that is the one property lost relative
// to the native route. The close reason and the already-closed check are read
// before the batch is dialed, so a row that changes in the gap is a row this
// route describes with a slightly stale reason. Every caller of this shape
// already re-reads and retries on the next reconciler tick, and the alternative
// — dialing a read per item inside a request that has not been built yet — is
// not available on a batch API.

// errBatchTxUnrecordable reports a Store.Tx callback that asked for something
// the batch route cannot express. It is its own sentinel so a caller can tell
// "this backend cannot do transactions at all" from "this backend cannot do
// THIS write in a transaction".
