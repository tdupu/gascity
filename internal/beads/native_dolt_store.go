	// injected reopen hook, because opening the library means mutating the
	// process environment under nativeDoltOpenEnvMu and, while a reader exists
	// to carry it, a background ticker is the wrong place for that.
	//
	// "While a reader exists" is the whole rule, not a hedge (council pr2
	// D-F12). A handle that has already stood down non-terminally has no native
	// leaf, so no read reaches this mark or the reopen hook, and the guard tick
	// DOES open the library there itself — see recoverNative in
	// proxied_guard_tick.go, whose header states the exception and its budget.
	// This mark is only ever the serving handle's mechanism.
	//
	// It is false on every direct and hosted handle — only the proxied guard tick
	// sets it — so the read path's extra atomic load is the whole cost of the
	// mechanism on those lanes.
	//
	// It is an EPOCH rather than a flag (council A-F4). A flag was cleared
	// unconditionally once the reconnect returned, with no compare-and-swap
	// against the mark being serviced, and the window that opens is the exact
	// hazard the mechanism exists for. Tick T1 sees generation A->B, adopts B's
	// pin and marks the pool stale. Reader R enters withReadRetry, sees the
	// mark and calls repinStalePool, which can sit inside the reopen hook for
	// hundreds of milliseconds — the re-admission, the ladder's sleeps, the
	// library open. While R is in there, tick T2 sees B->C, adopts C's pin and
	// marks again; the flag is already true, so nothing happens. R installs
	// B's storage and clears the flag. The handle now serves reads from
	// generation B's socket while the pin says C, and no later tick marks it
	// again because checkGeneration compares the record against pin C and
	// reports Held. On the root-move shape that is silent wrong-database reads
	// for the life of the handle.
	//
	// That epoch was still not enough (council pr2 D-F6): it was cleared with
	// CompareAndSwap(seen, 0), so the counter went back to zero and the swap
	// was an ABA test, not a watermark. Two readers R1 and R2 both load mark 1;
	// R2 reconnects and clears to 0 while R1 is parked on the reconnect gate;
	// tick T2 marks — the counter is 1 AGAIN; R1 wakes, finds another reader
	// already reconnected, and its CAS(1, 0) succeeds and erases T2's mark. The
	// same loss happened when the install that satisfied R1 came from a
	// transient-error reconnect whose reopen began BEFORE the mark.
	//
	// So poolStale is now MONOTONIC — markPoolStale increments it and nothing
	// ever decrements it — and poolServiced is a separate watermark: the mark
	// value snapshotted immediately before the reopen whose storage is now
	// installed began (see reconnect). A re-point is owed exactly while
	// poolStale > poolServiced. A reader no longer clears anything on its own
	// say-so; only an install can advance the watermark, and only to the marks

// every other re-point in this package has: RunInTransaction is off the v0
// served surface, so the hand-composed version was a hard failure on any store
// reached over the wire. The role is a required member of the Storage
// contract, and its guard is evaluated inside the releasing transaction, so
// the atomicity the old shape built by hand is the role's own promise.
//
// ExpectedAssignee is ALWAYS supplied, and that is the whole method. A nil
// expectation selects the role's unconditional path, whose ownership fence's
// subject is the ACTOR — and gc's actor is the city, never the holder — so a
// nil expectation would release a claim this front door was told to leave
// alone. An empty holder is therefore not a release at all: it dials nothing
// and reports "not released", which is also what the role would say about it
// (a row nobody holds is ErrNotClaimed).
//
// A CONDITIONAL REFUSAL IS A VALUE, NOT AN ERROR, which is this front door's
// contract and the reason the mapping is not a pass-through. The role refuses
// with a typed sentinel for each of the four ways a conditional release can
// fail to happen — a different holder, no claim, a status that accepts no
// release, a bead that is gone — and every one of them is the same fact to a
// reconciler: the claim is not ours to give back. Everything else travels,
// because a transport failure reported as "not released" would leave a caller
// believing a claim is still held.
//
// TWO THINGS THE ROLE DOES THAT THE HAND-BUILT VERSION DID NOT, both improvements
// and both worth knowing:
//
//   - THE HOLDER COMPARISON IS SEPARATOR-INSENSITIVE. A run of ".", "_" or "-"
//     matches any other such run, so "agent-a", "agent_a" and "agent.a" are one
//     holder where the old byte-exact comparison saw three. gc composes its
//     expectation from an assignee a read gave it, so this widens nothing gc
//     asks for; it forgives a caller that reached the same identity through a
//     layer that spells separators differently. Nothing else is forgiven — the
//     value is neither trimmed nor case-folded.
//   - THE RELEASE DROPS THE LEASE AND REMINTS THE ROW VERSION. The old
//     two-field status/assignee write left the lease row behind and moved no
//     version, so a concurrent reclaim could silently merge with it.
//
// TWO FAMILY DIVERGENCES THIS OPENED, both recorded on
// ConditionalAssignmentReleaser in beads.go rather than here, because they are
// facts about the store FAMILY and not about this implementation: the role
// releases from open as well as in_progress where MemStore, SQLiteStore and
// the pre-role version of this method released only from in_progress; and an
// empty expected holder over an in_progress row with an empty assignee is
// (false, nil) here where MemStore answers true. Neither is pinned by a

// member of the Storage contract, and its CAS plus retry-on-commit-conflict
// are the role's own promise rather than something this front door has to
// rebuild.
//
// The (Bead, bool, error) idiom matches SQLiteStore.Claim and BdStore.Claim: a
// conflict — someone else holds the bead, or its status is not claimable — is
// reported as ok=false with a nil error, never as an error value, because a
// losing claim attempt is an expected, non-exceptional outcome every caller
// of this capability already treats as a value (claim_class_route.go,
// class_store_emit.go). issueops.ErrAlreadyClaimed and issueops.ErrNotClaimable
// (and the *issueops.ClaimConflictError that wraps either one over the wire)
// are both folded into that false verdict by nativeClaimConflict.
//
// A MISSING BEAD IS ErrNotFound, NOT A CONFLICT — this is the one place Claim
// deliberately parts ways with ReleaseIfCurrent, which folds a not-found row
// into its own false-verdict idiom because "nobody holds it" is the same fact
// release already reports for an unclaimed row. A claim has no equivalent
// benign reading of "the bead does not exist": it is a caller error every
// other Store.Claim implementation already surfaces as an error (see
// SQLiteStore.Claim, BdStore.Claim), so this front door does too, via the
// ordinary nativeStoreError not-found translation every other role accessor
// in this file uses.
//
// A WISP ID GETS A NAMED REFUSAL, ErrWispNotClaimable, NOT A BARE ErrNotFound.
// issueops.Claimer's CAS addresses only the issues table, so the claimer
// reports a wisp id with the same ErrNotFound sentinel it uses for an id that
// does not exist anywhere. The two are not the same fact for a caller: "this
// id is a wisp, no front door serving this role can ever claim it" calls for
// a different response (log it once and move on) than "this id does not
// exist" (a caller bug or a stale reference worth surfacing loudly).
//
// Telling them apart takes a second read. When the claimer's error resolves
// to issueops.ErrNotFound, nativeClaimTargetIsWisp asks the reader role for
// id; unlike the claimer, the reader resolves the wisp table too
// (issueops.Reader.Get: "A miss — for both the issue and the wisp table — is
// ErrNotFound"). Claim reports ErrWispNotClaimable only when that read returns
// a row carrying the wisp-plane marker (Ephemeral or NoHistory). The two reads
// are not atomic, so the verdict describes the row the second read observed:
// an ordinary issue created or promoted between them carries no marker and
// keeps the claimer's ErrNotFound. A miss or a failed read keeps it too, so
// the disambiguating read never manufactures a wisp refusal. Either way the
// window is benign: the claim wrote nothing, and the caller's next attempt
// sees the current row.
//
// THE DISAMBIGUATING READ GOES THROUGH THE storage HANDLE AND ctx CLAIM
// ALREADY HOLDS, NEVER THROUGH s.Get. Claim still holds s.mu.RLock here
// (acquireStorage above, released only on return via the deferred release()).
// s.Get funnels through withReadRetry, which re-takes s.mu via
// acquireStorageGen and, on a transient read error, reconnects via
// s.mu.Lock() — both of which are a second, nested lock request from the SAME
// goroutine that already holds the outer RLock. Go's sync.RWMutex is not
// reentrant and gives a blocked Lock() writer priority over new readers, so
// either shape self-deadlocks the goroutine permanently: a pending writer (a
// reconnect swap or CloseStore racing in from elsewhere) blocks the nested
// RLock forever behind itself, and a transient failure on the disambiguating
// read alone reaches reconnect's s.mu.Lock() while this same goroutine's outer
// RLock is still held, which can never be granted. Reading directly off the
// storage and ctx Claim already has avoids taking s.mu a second time at all,
// so neither shape can occur; a transient error here keeps the claimer's
