// The role-accessor front doors for the three issue reads: the detail view, the
// listing and the ready frontier.
//
// The reason is the one the graph and delete front doors already carry, and it
// is sharper here. SearchIssues over the v0 wire serves exactly TWO shapes —
// exact-ids and the parent walk — and refuses every other filter, so every gc
// listing except Children was a hard failure on a served city. GetReadyWork is
// served only as a bridge, and it refuses any WorkFilter.Status other than open
// by name (encode's E-WorkFilter.Status), which is precisely what the old
// two-status Ready loop sent on its second pass: Ready failed outright.
// issueops.Reader is a required member of the Storage contract, so routing
// through it is the ONE path every backend answers.
//
// WHAT MOVED WITH THE DOOR, stated once because all three reads share it: the
// role is a HIGH-LEVEL request, not a filter. It applies bd's own list policy
// — the closed and pinned status exclusions, the template, gate and infra-type
// suppressions, the ephemeral-plane decision, and a DEFAULT PAGE SIZE — inside,
// where the raw filter this replaced applied none of it. Every one of those is
// a NARROWING, and adopting a narrowing under a re-point would silently drop
// rows gc lists today. So the request below lifts all of them and gc's own
// ListQuery projection (ApplyListQuery) does the exact filtering it already
// did. What that costs is recorded on nativeListLimitPushdown.

// nativeListReadRequest is the shape every gc listing sends.
//
// AllFlag is doing two jobs, and the second is the one that decides the
// spelling. It drops the default STATUS exclusions (closed, pinned, and any
// workspace status in the done or frozen category), and it lifts the
// PINNED-FLAG default: workapi.BuildListFilter stamps Pinned=&false for every
// request that neither sets AllFlag nor names a pinned-selecting status, so a
// named status — even "closed", even the exact status gc asked for — would drop
// a pinned-flagged row that the raw search returned.
//
// Status:"all" IS AN EQUIVALENT SPELLING of that lift, not a second option and
// not a road not taken: BuildListFilter reads it through the same
// splitStatusSelector, and a lone "all" both skips the exclusion default (its
// len(statusParts)==0 arm) and satisfies statusSelectsPinned, so the two
// requests resolve to the same filter, and both cross the wire (`all` and
// `status` are each published). The only other lifts of the pinned half are
// "pinned" and "hooked", and neither lifts the status exclusions, so neither
// is a substitute. AllFlag is stated because it says what it does in the member
// name rather than in a magic status value.
//
// There is no ExcludeStatus member to spell "everything but closed"
// with, so the status axis cannot be pushed down at all; gc's three-value
// projection (mapBdStatus, ListQuery.Matches) is the only definition of it and
// it runs Go-side, where it always did.
//
// The four include flags lift the type and plane suppressions in the same
// spirit. They are stated individually rather than as IncludeAllTypes because
// that member is refused on the wire (E-ListRequest.IncludeAllTypes) and this
// request has to cross it. IncludeInfra alone would already open the ephemeral
// plane — it is strictly wider than IncludeEphemeral, admitting both the infra
// TYPES and the wisps TABLE — but IncludeEphemeral is stated beside it because
// the two are separate promises: one keeps message/agent/role rows, the other
// keeps the plane, and a future change to either upstream must not silently
// take the other with it.

// Get retrieves a bead by ID: the row from the reader role's detail view, the
// edges from EdgeReader.
//
// THE DETAIL VIEW IS THE ONE TOKEN SOURCE. issueops.IssueDetails.Revision is
// the only place the optimistic-concurrency token is published to a client: the
// row's own RowVersion is json:"-" and never crosses a wire, so a store that
// read RowVersion off a served row would hand every guarded write a fabricated
// 0 — which, being a real value that matches an un-mutated legacy row, is the
// one wrong answer a CAS cannot detect. A LIST row publishes no token at all,
// and Bead.Revision is left at zero there deliberately: absent is absent, never
// 0, and a caller that means to act on a row it listed re-reads it here first.
//
// THE EDGES ARE THE STORED ROWS, read by the same door DepList's DOWN leg uses.
// The detail view lists the far-end ISSUES rather than the edge rows, so an
// edge whose target is an "external:" reference or an id in another ledger —
// a cross-ledger molecule parent, most often — has no entry there. This store
// declares its rows complete (listIncludesCompleteDependencies), so a cache
// installs a Get row's edge set as the bead's whole topology, and a thinner set
// would erase those edges from every cached dependency walk. ParentID is
// derived from the same set, so a parent this store cannot resolve still
// round-trips. The two reads are two transactions: an edge written between them
// is seen by the next read, and a bead deleted between them is ErrNotFound —
// the later read is the answer.
//
// A miss is ErrNotFound on both sides of the door — the role promises it, and
// the wire's problem mapper turns a 404 into the same sentinel — and a backend
// failure passes through unchanged rather than decaying into not-found.
//
// The two include parameters stay off. Bead carries neither dependents nor
// comments, and both are the expensive row lists the detail view exists to
// avoid materializing.

// G10, THE DEFERRED RE-EXPRESSION. This used to be a loop over two bd statuses.
// The wire publishes no status on the ready operation and

// the second pass — status=deferred, keeping only the rows whose defer_until
// had already expired — is not askable here. It is also not NEEDED, and that is
// a measured fact rather than an assumption: every backend runs the lazy
// defer-wake sweep in its own write transaction immediately before the ready
// read (issueops.WakeExpiredDefersInTx, called from
// internal/storage/{dolt,embeddeddolt}/queries.go and the unit-of-work reader),
// and that sweep flips exactly the rows the second pass was looking for —
// status='deferred' AND defer_until <= now — to open. They arrive in the FIRST
// answer, already woken. What stays hidden is what stayed hidden before: an
// indefinite deferral, which carries no defer_until and which the sweep
// therefore never touches.
//
// THE ONE RESIDUE is a READ-ONLY store, where the sweep declines to run (it is
// a write) and an expired deferral keeps its status. gc no longer resurfaces it
// there. Neither does `bd ready` against the same store, which is the point:
// this door answers what bd answers, and the old second pass was gc diverging
// from it.
//
// IncludeDeferred stays OFF. It looks like the natural spelling for "let the
// deferred rows through and filter them here", and it is not: turning it on
// also drops the deferred-CHILD exclusion (sqlbuild.BuildReadyWorkWhere
// consults ReadyWorkWhereInputs.DeferredChildIDs only while the flag is off),
// which admits the children of a future-deferred parent — rows carrying no
// defer_until of their own, that no Go-side filter here can identify.

// ready frontier failed outright before this chunking existed.
// filterReadyByWorkOutcome sends ReadEdges in chunks of at most this many
// candidate ids and merges the anchors, so a ready frontier of any size
// degrades to more calls rather than one failing call. Keeping this as an alias
// of nativeServerEdgeAnchorCap (defined beside DepListBatch's identical chunk
// in native_dolt_store_roles.go) means both of this package's ReadEdges chunk
// sizes move together if the server's cap ever changes.

// no documented id-count cap of its own on a listing's IDFilter the way
// ReadEdges has maxDependencyAnchors, but an http-native IssueReader still
// puts every id on one URL query string with nothing bounding its length, so
// this reuses nativeServerEdgeAnchorCap — the one id-count cap this package
// already knows a served backend accepts — rather than leaving blocker-veto
// listing unchunked against an unverified assumption.
const nativeReadyVetoListChunkSize = nativeServerEdgeAnchorCap

// nativeReadyEdgeFanoutLimit bounds concurrent per-blocker IssueReader.Get
// calls in filterReadyByWorkOutcome's blocker fetch. It matches the batch

// filterReadyByWorkOutcome removes candidates whose blocking dependencies are
// closed but recorded gc.work_outcome=blocked. The role's own readiness check
// only looks at status==closed, so it does not know that a blocked-outcome
// close should not satisfy a blocking dependency (ga-a7v0ex).
//
// This is a NARROW override on top of an already-authoritative verdict, not a
// from-scratch recompute of blocking status — see BdStore.filterReadyByWorkOutcome
// for the full rationale, which applies identically here. Deliberately NOT
// DependencySatisfied: a candidate is here because the ready read already
// cleared its gating, which is richer than "the target is closed" (a pinned
// blocker satisfies a blocks edge, and a waits-for edge gates on the spawner's
// children rather than the spawner's own status). Only the closed-and-blocked
// case — invisible to the store's own check — may override that verdict.
//
// It runs INSIDE Ready's withReadRetry closure on the caller's ctx/storage, so
// it must not call anything that re-enters withReadRetry.
//
// The read is two role requests whatever the frontier size: a chunked
// EdgeReader read of every candidate's own edges (nativeReadEdgesChunkSize,
// merged across chunks — the server rejects a ReadEdges call outright once its
// anchor count exceeds its own cap, rather than serving the first N and
// reporting the rest missing), and a blocker-outcome read that tries
// IssueReader.List(IDFilter) FIRST and falls back to a fan-out of
// IssueReader.Get calls — one per DISTINCT ready-blocking target id, bounded
// at nativeReadyEdgeFanoutLimit concurrency — only when that List refuses.
//
// List first, not Get-only, because a native (dolt or Postgres) IssueReader
// answers List+IDFilter in one SQL statement regardless of the blocker count,
// while an unconditional per-id Get fan-out against THAT backend costs several
// round trips per blocker every controller tick — the same #6491 pattern the
// fan-out exists to avoid for an http-native backend. Only an http-native
// IssueReader refuses this shape — the http client's encode table,
// E-ListRequest.IDFilter, leaves the exact-ids question to getIssue rather than
// to a listing filter — and it refuses CLIENT-SIDE, before any round trip, with
// a client error that unwraps to a typed *beadslib.ErrUnsupported (errors.As
// reaches it through the chain). Get is the wire's door for that exact-ids
// question instead, and it is a per-id door, so fan-out is the fallback's only
// route to it. The List call is its own capability probe — answered or refused
// in the same call, with no separate capability check. A per-candidate Get is
// one round trip each on a served store, which over a network link exhausted
// the read-retry budget every controller tick (#6491), so only the backend that
// actually requires the fan-out pays for it. A target the read does not return
// — an external reference, another ledger's row — is no evidence of blocking,
// on either leg.
//
// The result does not depend on edge or fetch order: every fetched target's
// metadata is parsed exactly once up front, and a malformed one is reported
// against the first candidate (in candidate order) that references it,
// choosing the lowest target id when that candidate references more than one.
// A real (non-ErrNotFound) blocker fetch failure fails the whole filter —
// never silently passing the candidate it would have vetoed — and cancels any
// still-queued fan-out calls rather than paying for every remaining blocker
// fetch before reporting an error it already had.

// both tiers — which is the shape the aggregate readers that fought for this
// pushdown already use (orders' RecentRuns/LastRun and the event cursor, all
// Label + IncludeClosed + TierBoth).
//
// THE COST THIS BUYS, recorded rather than discovered later: a durable-tier or
// typed or not-closed listing now fetches the whole candidate set and cuts the
// page in Go. That is the same class of cost as the wire's own L2 (a non-created
